<h2>Lucky Review</h2>
    <p>Locally owned chained, not owned by Kroger's, but by Dave's (the one in Cleveland). High prices, decent quality.
        I can find alot of bulk items, but not since COVID, and specialty herbs.
        I had a friend there once who worked in the meat department but he walked out on the job.
        You can walk around with a beer and/or wine while you're shopping so that's cool.
        Overall 3/5 stars.</p>
